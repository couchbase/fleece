    /** \defgroup FLKeyPath   Fleece Paths
        @{
     An FLKeyPath Describes a location in a Fleece object tree, as a path from the root that follows
     dictionary properties and array elements.
     It's similar to a JSONPointer or an Objective-C KeyPath, but simpler (so far.)
     The path is compiled into an efficient form that can be traversed quickly.

     It looks like `foo.bar[2][-3].baz` -- that is, properties prefixed with a `.`, and array
     indexes in brackets. (Negative indexes count from the end of the array.)

     A leading JSONPath-like `$.` is allowed but ignored.

     A '\' can be used to escape a special character ('.', '[' or '$') at the start of a
     property name (but not yet in the middle of a name.)
