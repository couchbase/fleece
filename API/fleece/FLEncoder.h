    /** \defgroup FLEncoder   Fleece Encoders
        @{
        An FLEncoder generates encoded Fleece or JSON data. It's sort of a structured output stream,
        with nesting. There are functions for writing every type of scalar value, and for beginning
        and ending collections. To write a collection you begin it, write its values, then end it.
        (Of course a value in a collection can itself be another collection.) When writing a
        dictionary, you have to call writeKey before writing each value.
